Welcome to sot-gui's documentation!
===================================
sot-gui is a Graphical User Interface to StackOfTask, a software framework developped at CNRS-LAAS [#f1]_ and
JRL [#f2]_ laboratories.

sot-gui is written entirely in Python, using the PyGTK [#f3]_ and xdot [#f4]_
to display graph; omniORGpy [#f5]_ to communicate with StackOfTask.
